      "0  You are an expert Python programmer. You will be given a question (problem specification) and will generate a correct Python program that matches the specification and passes all tests.\\n\\n### Question:\\nGiven an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.\\nYou may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\\nYou can return the answer in any order.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\\nOutput: [0,1]\\nExplanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6\\nOutput: [1,2]\\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: nums = [3,3], target = 6\\nOutput: [0,1]\\n\\n \\nConstraints:\\n\\n2 <= nums.length <= 104\\n-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\\n-109 <= target <= 109\\nOnly one valid answer exists.\\n\\n \\nFollow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?\\n\\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\n        \\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n   \n",

      "0  To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the numbers we have seen so far and their indices. This allows us to check in constant time whether the complement of the current number (i.e., `target - current_number`) has already been encountered. This approach reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).\\n\\nHere's the implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\n        # Create a dictionary to store the numbers and their indices\\n        num_to_index = {}\\n        \\n        # Iterate over the list of numbers\\n        for index, num in enumerate(nums):\\n            # Calculate the complement\\n            complement = target - num\\n            \\n            # Check if the complement is already in the dictionary\\n            if complement in num_to_index:\\n                # If found, return the indices of the complement and the current number\\n                return [num_to_index[complement], index]\\n            \\n            # Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the dictionary\\n            num_to_index[num] = index\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n1. We initialize an empty dictionary `num_to_index` to store numbers and their indices as we iterate through the list.\\n2. For each number in the list, we calculate its complement with respect to the target.\\n3. We check if this complement is already in the dictionary:\\n   - If it is, we have found the two numbers that add up to the target, and we return their indices.\\n   - If it is not, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary.\\n4. This approach ensures that we only pass through the list once, achieving a time complexity of O(n).  \n"

      "response: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of subsequences in the array `nums` that have an odd sum. Given the constraints, a direct approach that checks all possible subsequences is infeasible due to the exponential number of subsequences. Instead, we can use a more efficient approach based on dynamic programming and combinatorial counting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Observations:\n",
      "1. **Odd and Even Elements**: The sum of a subsequence is odd if and only if it contains an odd number of odd elements.\n",
      "2. **Counting Subsequences**: For each element in the array, we can either include it in a subsequence or not. This gives us \\(2^n\\) possible subsequences for an array of length \\(n\\).\n",
      "3. **Using Combinatorics**: We can count the number of odd elements and even elements separately. The number of ways to choose an odd number of odd elements from the odd elements and any number of even elements is the key to solving this problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Approach:\n",
      "1. Count the number of odd elements (`odd_count`) and even elements (`even_count`) in the array.\n",
      "2. Calculate the total number of ways to choose an odd number of odd elements:\n",
      "   - For each `k` (where `k` is odd and `0 <= k <= odd_count`), calculate the number of ways to choose `k` odd elements from `odd_count` odd elements and multiply it by the number of ways to choose any number of even elements from `even_count` even elements.\n",
      "3. Sum these values to get the total number of subsequences with an odd sum.\n",
      "4. Return the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation:\n",
      "Here is the implementation of the above approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from typing import List\n",

      "        \n",
      "        # Count the number of odd and even elements\n",
      "        odd_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 == 1)\n",
      "        even_count = len(nums) - odd_count\n",

      "        return result\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation:\n",
      "- We use `comb(odd_count, k)` to count the number of ways to choose `k` odd elements from `odd_count` odd elements.\n",
      "- We use `2 ** even_count` to count the number of ways to choose any number of even elements from `even_count` even elements.\n",
      "- We sum these values for all odd `k` to get the total number of subsequences with an odd sum.\n",
      "- Finally, we return the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach efficiently counts the number of subsequences with an odd sum in \\(O(n + \\log(\\text{odd\\_count}))\\) time, which is suitable given the problem constraints.\n",
